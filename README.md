# Soft-Skills-Training-App
The app acts as a support tool for the process of acquiring transversal skills initiated through the other project outputs such as the board game.
The app has been designed to allow anyone to use it based on their knowledge on the subject, giving users the opportunity to practice the use of daily soft skills in a completely autonomous way. The app contains 60 tasks divided into groups of 12 that identify the 5 categories of soft skills. On a daily basis, the user can choose from these 60 activities to carry out and create their own list of daily tests, to be completed completely independently according to their personal needs or preferences.
The app combines the typical elements of gamification and the experience of exercising soft skills, acting as a self-analysis tool that can lead to constant personal and relational improvement.
The app is available in English language, but can be translated using e.g. Google Translator.
